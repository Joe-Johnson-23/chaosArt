# Chaos Art

An interactive visualization of double pendulum physics, creating mesmerizing patterns through mathematical chaos.

## Overview

This project explores the fascinating world of chaos theory through the lens of double pendulum motion. By visualizing the paths traced by multiple pendulums, it creates unique, never-repeating patterns that demonstrate the beauty of mathematical chaos.

## Features

- Real-time double pendulum physics simulation
- Interactive controls for pendulum parameters
- Multiple visualization modes:
  - Prism mode for colorful trail effects
  - Freefall gravity mode
  - Hidden pendulum mode ('h' key)
- Adjustable gravity and vacuum conditions
- Dynamic trail effects

## Technologies Used

- React
- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript Physics Engine
- Vite
